      To change the default size or layout margins of the speech recognition 'View's and hint labels
      redefine the dimensions here.
      Dimensions 'button_record_size' and 'button_record_margin_end' define the size or layout
      margins of the record button, end recording slider and speech recognition button,
      since end recording slider and speech recognition button are set relative to the record button.

      Note:
      You don't have to redefine the dimension here if you're not changing it.
      Dimensions here are redefined to the default values just for example.
